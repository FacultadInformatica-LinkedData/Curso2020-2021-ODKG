1. Get all the properties that can be applied to instances of the Politician class
SELECT  DISTINCT ?prop

WHERE {

   <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>  ^rdf:type     ?x.
       ?x      ?prop          ?values 
   
}

2. Get all the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied to instances of the Politician class

SELECT  DISTINCT ?prop

WHERE {

   ?x          a           <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>;
            ?prop          ?values
  FILTER(?prop!= rdf:type)
}

3. Which different values exist for the properties, except for rdf:type, applicable to
 the instances of Politician?

SELECT DISTINCT ?values

WHERE {

   ?x          a           <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>;
            ?prop          ?values
  FILTER(?prop!= rdf:type)
}

4. For each of these applicable properties, except for rdf:type, which different values do 
they take globally for all those instances?

SELECT DISTINCT ?prop ?values

WHERE {

   ?x          a           <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>;
            ?prop          ?values
  FILTER(?prop!= rdf:type)
}

5. For each of these applicable properties, except for rdf:type, how many distinct
 values do they take globally for all those instances?

SELECT ?prop (COUNT(DISTINCT?values) AS ?pvalues)

WHERE {

   ?x          a           <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>;
            ?prop          ?values
  FILTER(?prop!= rdf:type)
}
GROUP BY ?prop ORDER BY DESC(?pvalues)
