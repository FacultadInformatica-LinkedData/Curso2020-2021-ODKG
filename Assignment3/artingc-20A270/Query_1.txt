# 1.- Get all the properties that can be applied to instances of the Politician class (<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>)

# Doubt: Does the relation rdf:type take into account the subclass of the Politician class? If not, we should change (?instance a ont:Politician.) by (?class rdfs:subClassOf/rdfs:subClassOf* ont:Politician.	{?instance a ?class} UNION {?instance a ont:Politician})
