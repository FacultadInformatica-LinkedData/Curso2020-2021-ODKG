PREFIX ex: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

SELECT DISTINCT ?prop 
WHERE{
  ?x a ex:Politician. ?x ?prop ?y
} 

2. Get all the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied to instances of the Politician class

PREFIX ex: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

SELECT DISTINCT ?prop 
WHERE{
  ?x a ex:Politician. ?x ?prop ?y
  FILTER (?prop != rdf:type)
}

3. Which different values exist for the properties, except for rdf:type, applicable to the instances of Politician?

PREFIX ex: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

SELECT DISTINCT ?value 
WHERE{
  ?x a ex:Politician. ?x ?prop ?y
  FILTER (?prop != rdf:type)
  ?value ?prop ?x
}

4. For each of these applicable properties, except for rdf:type, which different values do they take globally for all those instances?

PREFIX ex: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

SELECT DISTINCT ?value ?prop
WHERE{
  ?x a ex:Politician. ?x ?prop ?y
  FILTER (?prop != rdf:type)
  ?value ?prop ?x
}

5. For each of the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied to instances of the Politician class, how many distinct values do they take in those instances?

PREFIX ex: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
SELECT DISTINCT ?prop COUNT (DISTINCT ?value)
WHERE{
  ?x a ex:Politician. ?x ?prop ?y
  FILTER (?prop != rdf:type)
  ?value ?prop ?x
}
