1.	Get all the properties that can be applied to instances of the Politician class (<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>)
SELECT DISTINCT ?properties WHERE {
  ?x rdf:type <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>. ?x ?properties ?z
  }
2.	Get all the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied to instances of the Politician class
SELECT DISTINCT ?properties WHERE {
  ?x rdf:type <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>. ?x ?properties ?z 
  FILTER (?properties != rdf:type) 
  }
3.	Which different values exist for the properties, except for rdf:type, applicable to the instances of Politician?
SELECT DISTINCT ?values WHERE {
  ?x rdf:type <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>. ?x ?properties ?values 
  FILTER (?properties !=  rdf:type) 
  }
4.	For each of these applicable properties, except for rdf:type, which different values do they take globally for all those instances?
SELECT DISTINCT ?properties ?values WHERE {
  ?x rdf:type <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>. ?x ?properties ?values 
  FILTER (?properties !=  rdf:type) 
  }
5.	For each of these applicable properties, except for rdf:type, how many distinct values do they take globally for all those instances?
SELECT DISTINCT ?properties COUNT (DISTINCT ?values) WHERE {
  ?x rdf:type <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>. ?x ?properties ?values 
  FILTER (?properties !=  rdf:type) 
  }
