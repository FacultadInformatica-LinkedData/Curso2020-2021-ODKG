Create the SPARQL query and the result for the following queries expressed in natural language. The endpoint that you can use for this exercise is: http://es.dbpedia.org/sparql

1-Get all the properties that can be applied to instances of the Politician class (<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>)

PREFIX : <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>


SELECT DISTINCT ?prop
WHERE{
   ?x a/rdfs:subClassOf* :Politician.
   ?x ?prop ?z.
}LIMIT 1000

2-Get all the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied to instances of the Politician class

PREFIX : <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>


SELECT DISTINCT ?prop
WHERE{
   ?x a/rdfs:subClassOf* :Politician.
   ?x ?prop ?z.
FILTER (?prop != rdf:type)
}LIMIT 1000

3-Which different values exist for the properties, except for rdf:type, applicable to the instances of Politician?

PREFIX : <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>


SELECT DISTINCT ?z
WHERE{
   ?x a/rdfs:subClassOf* :Politician.
   ?x ?prop ?z.
FILTER (?prop != rdf:type)
}LIMIT 1000

4-For each of these applicable properties, except for rdf:type, which different values do they take globally for all those instances?

PREFIX : <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>


SELECT DISTINCT ?z ?prop
WHERE{
   ?x a/rdfs:subClassOf* :Politician.
   ?x ?prop ?z.
FILTER (?prop != rdf:type)
}LIMIT 1000

5-For each of these applicable properties, except for rdf:type, how many distinct values do they take globally for all those instances?

PREFIX : <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>


SELECT DISTINCT COUNT( DISTINCT ?prop) ?z
WHERE{
   ?x a/rdfs:subClassOf* :Politician.
   ?x ?prop ?z.
FILTER (?prop != rdf:type)
}LIMIT 1000
