WHERE {
?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
?x ?properties ?y
}


2. Get all the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied to instances of the Politician class

SELECT DISTINCT ?properties 
WHERE {
?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
?x ?properties ?y
FILTER (?properties != rdf:type)
}


3. Which different values exist for the properties, except for rdf:type, applicable to the instances of Politician?

SELECT DISTINCT ?values 
WHERE {
?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
?x ?properties ?values
FILTER (?properties != rdf:type)
}


4. For each of these applicable properties, except for rdf:type, which different values do they take globally for all those instances?

SELECT DISTINCT ?properties ?values 
WHERE {
?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
?x ?properties ?values
FILTER (?properties != rdf:type)
}


5. For each of these applicable properties, except for rdf:type, how many distinct values do they take globally for all those instances?

SELECT DISTINCT ?properties COUNT (DISTINCT ?values) 
WHERE {
?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
?x ?properties ?values
FILTER (?properties != rdf:type)
}
