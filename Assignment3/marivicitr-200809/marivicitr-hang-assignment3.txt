1. Get all the properties that can be applied to instances of the Politician class (<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>)

SELECT DISTINCT ?p
WHERE 
{
  ?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
  ?x ?p ?z
}


2. Get all the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied to instances of the Politician class

SELECT DISTINCT ?p
WHERE 
{
  ?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
  ?x ?p ?z
  FILTER (?p != rdf:type)
}


3. Which different values exist for the properties, except rdf:type, of the instances of the Politician class?

SELECT DISTINCT ?z
WHERE 
{
  ?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
  ?x ?p ?z
  FILTER (?p != rdf:type)
}


4. For each of the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied to instances of the Politician class, which different values do they take in those instances?

SELECT DISTINCT ?p ?z
WHERE 
{
  ?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
  ?x ?p ?z
  FILTER (?p != rdf:type)
}


5. For each of the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied to instances of the Politician class, how many distinct values do they take in those instances?

SELECT DISTINCT ?p COUNT(DISTINCT ?z)
WHERE 
{
  ?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
  ?x ?p ?z
  FILTER (?p != rdf:type)
}
