{
 ?x rdf:type <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
 ?x ?p ?v

 ?x rdf:type <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
 ?x ?p ?v
 FILTER( ?p != rdf:type)
}
LIMIT 100

SELECT DISTINCT ?v
WHERE
{
 ?x rdf:type <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
 ?x ?p ?v
 FILTER( ?p != rdf:type)
}
LIMIT 100

SELECT DISTINCT ?p ?v
WHERE
{
 ?x rdf:type <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
 ?x ?p ?v
 FILTER( ?p != rdf:type)
}
LIMIT 100

WHERE
{
 ?x rdf:type <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
 ?x ?p ?v
 FILTER( ?p != rdf:type)
}
LIMIT 100
